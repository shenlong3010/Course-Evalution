# Course-Evalution
Project for CS375 - Course Evaluation
Group name: VAL

Team members: Loc Lam, Het Amin, Linh Vu

Ideas: 
1. Professor: Survey -> create a set of questions (Multiple Choice, Short Answer,...) -> store in database -> modify DOM to formatted display. View list of Surveys and Surveys' Answers. 

2. Student (if Professor Survey works, then we can deploy the survey on AWS/Heroku/FireBase): Course Evaluation -> receive a link to access and start -> submit to database.


Tools:
- HTML, CSS, Node.js, JS
- Database: Psql, Redis
- TypeScript

Scope:
Example: Google Form
how the interface will work?
Buttons (Submit, Answer Box, Survey Modification,...)
authenticate between taker/creator
